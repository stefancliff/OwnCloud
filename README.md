# OwnCloud
Simply put this is a final project I made for my final grade in Cloud Computing. The task was the create any cloud service of our choice and implement it. I chose OwnCloud as it was something that most companies try to have. Learning and creating my own smaller scale cloud system that was closed off seemed like a nice way to get a better idea of how everything works.
