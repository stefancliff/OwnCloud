# OwnCloud
Simply put this is a final project I made for my final grade in Cloud Computing. The task was the create any cloud service of our choice and implement it. I chose OwnCloud as it was something that most companies try to have. 
Learning and creating my own smaller scale cloud system that was closed off seemed like a nice way to get a better idea of how everything works.


The core technologies and software packages that I used are:
- Oracle Virtual Box
- PuTTY
- SSH
- Apache2
- MariaDB
